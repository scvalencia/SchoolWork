Consider a simple social network dataset consisting of key-value pairs where each key is a person and each value is a friend of that person. Describe a MapReduce algorithm to count he number of friends each person has.

Map Input
The input is a 2 element list: [personA, personB]


personA: Name of a person formatted as a string

personB: Name of one of personA’s friends formatted as a string


This implies that personB is a friend of personA, but it does not imply that personA is a friend of personB.

Reduce Output
The output should be a (person,  friend count) tuple.


person is a string and friend count is an integer describing the number of friends ‘person’ has.


You can test your solution to this problem using friends.json:


        python friend_count.py friends.json
