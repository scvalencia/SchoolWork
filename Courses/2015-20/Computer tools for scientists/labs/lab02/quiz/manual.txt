     The wwcc utility displays the number of lines, words, and bytes contained
     in each input _f_i_l_e, or standard input (if no file is specified) to the
     standard output.  A line is defined as a string of characters delimited
     by a <newline> character.  Characters beyond the final <newline> charac-
     ter will not be included in the line count.

     A word is defined as a string of characters delimited by white space
     characters.  White space characters are the set of characters for which
     the iswspace(3) function returns true.  If more than one input file is
     specified, a line of cumulative counts for all the files is displayed on
     a separate line after the output for the last file.

     The following options are available:

     --cc      The number of bytes in each input file is written to the standard
             output.  This will cancel out any prior usage of the --mm option.

     --ll      The number of lines in each input file is written to the standard
             output.

     --mm      The number of characters in each input file is written to the
             standard output.  If the current locale does not support multi-
             byte characters, this is equivalent to the --cc option.  This will
             cancel out any prior usage of the --cc option.

     --ww      The number of words in each input file is written to the standard
             output.

     When an option is specified, wwcc only reports the information requested by
     that option.  The order of output always takes the form of line, word,
     byte, and file name.  The default action is equivalent to specifying the
     --cc, --ll and --ww options.

     If no files are specified, the standard input is used and no file name is
     displayed.  The prompt will accept input until receiving EOF, or [^D] in
     most environments.

     The LANG, LC_ALL and LC_CTYPE environment variables affect the execution
     of wwcc as described in environ(7).

     The wwcc utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

     Count the number of characters, words and lines in each of the files
     _r_e_p_o_r_t_1 and _r_e_p_o_r_t_2 as well as the totals for both:

     Historically, the wwcc utility was documented to define a word as a ``maxi-
     mal string of characters delimited by <space>, <tab> or <newline> charac-
     ters''.  The implementation, however, did not handle non-printing charac-
     ters correctly so that ``  ^D^E  '' counted as 6 spaces, while
     ``foo^D^Ebar'' counted as 8 characters.  4BSD systems after 4.3BSD modi-
     fied the implementation to be consistent with the documentation.  This
     implementation defines a ``word'' in terms of the iswspace(3) function,
     as required by IEEE Std 1003.2 (``POSIX.2'').
